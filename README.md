# Description

This is an additional repository for the article titled as "Detecting and Clustering Students by their Gamification Behavior with Badges: A Case Study in Engineering Education" and submitted for publication to the International Journal of Engineering Education. It contais two additional sources:

- Source cody in Python of the scripts to mine App Engine Datastore and obtain the four badge metrics proposed in the article
- An additional report which contains an exploratory analysis, correlation among the different metrics, analysis by plot of specific students and the clustering of students by badge indicators, as described in the paper. 

Therefore, the procedure followed by the authors of the article is more transparent and can be replicated by the readers.
